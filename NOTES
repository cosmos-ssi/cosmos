Base virtual address of higher-half kernel stack: FFFF FEFF FFFF FFF8 (it grows down)

int 15h memory map is placed at 0x500

Usage/mapping of physical memory at kernel load and jmp:
0x00000000 - 0x000FFFFF: Identity-mapped, 1 megabyte
0x00100000 - 0x008FFFFF: Kernel stack, eight megabytes
0x00900000 - 0x010FFFFF: Kernel + heap, eight megabytes from 0xFFFF800000000000 - 0xFFFF8000007FFFFF   

Once MM is set up:
Direct map starts at virtual address FFFFC00000000000, limit 32TB (this is the
max physical memory CosmOS currently supports).
