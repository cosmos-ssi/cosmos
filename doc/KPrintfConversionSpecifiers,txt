KPRINTF CONVERSION SPECIFIERS DOCUMENTATION
ACCURATE AS OF: 2020-08-16

These conversion specifiers are modelled on standard C printf, but do not
exactly mirror them, as the situational needs are different.  Some features
will not exist, some new ones will be added, and some conversion specifiers
may not function exactly like they do in standard C printf.

%%	literal "%"
%hu	uint8_t converted to unsigned decimal notation
%u	uint16_t converted to unsigned decimal notation
%lu	uint32_t converted to unsigned decimal notation
%llu	uint64_t converted to unsigned decimal notation
