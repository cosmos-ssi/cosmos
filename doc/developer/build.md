# Building and Running CosmOS

## Prerequisites

CosmOS requires:

- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
- [NASM](http://nasm.us/)
- [binutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/)
- [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/)
- [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html)

## OS X installation

[HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/) can be used on OS X to install the prerequisites

`brew install x86_64-elf-binutils`

`brew install x86_64-elf-gcc`

`brew install x86_64-elf-gdb`

`brew install nasm`

`brew install qemu`

`brew install clang-format`

`brew install iwyu`

`brew install mtools`

OS X includes Clang.

## Ubuntu installation

On Ubuntu apt can be used on Linux to install the prerequisites

`sudo apt install git`

`sudo apt install gcc-10`

`sudo apt install make`

`sudo apt install nasm`

`sudo apt install qemu-system-x86`

`sudo apt install clang-format`

`sudo apt install iwyu`

`sudo apt install mtools`

# Building

CosmOS builds with [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

From the root directory:

`make clean;make`

# Running

The command `make qemu` will start QEMU and boot the image. The QEMU monitor is exposed on port 45454 and can be connected to with `telnet localhost:45454`

# Optional - Building with Docker (ktool)

As an alternative to installing the build tools (gcc, binutils, nasm) on your local machine, you can use Docker. Simply prefix any build-related command with `./ktool` to run the command inside the docker context. Scripts run in the working directory on the host, and the container is immediately destroyed after use.

For example:
`$ ./ktool make clean;make`
